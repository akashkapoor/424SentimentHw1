Steps:
1. Use given script to build vocabulary and bag of words represetation for each review.
	1.1 Feel free to extend as necessary.
2. Use some sort of feature selector to reduce the number of features.
3. Try different classifiers
4. Evaluate each of the classifiers in the following metrics:
	* Receiver Operating Characteristics curves on test data set.
	* Number of false positives & False negatives.
